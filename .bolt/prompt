By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes with Nativewind,
React hooks, and lucide-react-native for icons.

Use use components in /components/ui, example :
`
import { Text } from '@/components/ui';
`
Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.
